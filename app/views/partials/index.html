		<p>Hi, my name is Kyle and my username is <span class="monospace bold">kalmas</span>. This is my blog. I'm a web developer by trade with a hobbyist's interest in anything programming related (this week: <a ng-href="{{ code.link }}" target="_blank" class="label-interest">{{ code.name }}</a>). I'll talk code with anyone who will listen (too few), but I'm also likely wax enthusiastic in a conversation about the book I'm reading (<a ng-href="{{ book.link }}" target="_blank" class="label-interest">{{ book.name }}</a>), the music I'm listening to (<a ng-href="{{ music.link }}" target="_blank" class="label-interest">{{ music.name }}</a>), or the show I'm watching (<a ng-href="{{ tv.link }}" target="_blank" class="label-interest">{{ tv.name }}</a>). I'd like to hope that this blog will serve as a place for me to write about all of my interests, but if behavior predicted by my past time/passion ratios holds true, it will be mostly dedicated to programming. While it feels more than a little self-indulgent to write about whatever trivial problem I'm working on today, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/02/fear-of-writing.html" target="_blank">enough</a> <a href="http://www.hitthebits.com/2012/04/why-every-programmer-should-have-blog.html" target="_blank">other</a> <a href="http://www.joergm.com/2010/01/why-all-programmers-should-blog/" target="_blank">blogs</a> have convinced me that I should. If this blog motivates me to finish more projects and think more deeply about programming, it will have served it's purpose. If it provides anything useful or interesting to someone besides me... well that's spectacular. In the interest of keeping the self-indulgence to a minimum, I'll close here: at a point where the area set aside for biography is appropriately filled with non-lorem-ipsum text. Thanks for reading.</p>
